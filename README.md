AI Belvedere: Chatbot UI for Teams, Small Companies, or Families

A self-hosted chatbot UI indended to facilitate PAYG (Pay-As-You-Go) access to frontier AI LLM models for smaller companies and private groups (friends, families). Focuses on reduced complexity, easy selection of best supported models (currently by OpenAI and Anthropic) for each new chat.

Originally based on "BetterChatGPT" project by Jing Hua (https://github.com/ztjhz/BetterChatGPT), but at this point it was significantly modified with little possibility to merge upstream.

# üî• Features

- Currently supports OpenAI and Anthropic models (Google Gemini is TBD)
- Server-Side secure management the API keys, and implement basic usage logging (only metadata, not conversations content)
- Containerized build is tested with deployment to Azure Container Apps (CI/CD workflow provided),
including support for Azure AD Single Sign-On authentication
- Containerized build is tested with deployment to self-hosted Docker environment with authentication with Auth0. This is a good choice for personal and familt deployments.
- Prompt Library
- Dark Mode
- Add Clarification button to quickly amending the previous message (instead of lengtherning the thread)
- Organize chats into folders (with colours), filter chats and folders
- Keeps track and displays tokens count and pricing estimates
- Quick model selection window for new chats (with hotkeys)
- Chat title auto-generation
- Chats, and unsent message drafts are automatically persisted to browser's local storage
- Import / Export of chat history
- Download Chat (markdown, json, PNG)
- Multiple language support (i18n) -> currently narrowed down to English and Russian (other languages i18n existed in the upstream project, but these translations were not maintained with fork changes)

Features that existed in the original project, but were hidden or removed
- Conversation publishing to ShareGPT - removed for privacy considerations
- Conversations sync to Google Drive  - removed for privacy considerations
- Advanced options to edit the thread such as rearranging the messages, changing roles, etc. There was no obvious business use-case, it looked complex, and it did not work with Anthropic models.

# üõ†Ô∏è Deployment to Koyeb.com + Auth0

### Why Koyeb.com? 
- As of September 2024, Koyeb.com serverless platform provides Free Tier plan that is sufficient for this deployment 
- Similar free tier are available at Render.com and few other providers - but these will be spinning down the application when it's was not used and will have a significant cold start delay.
- Koyeb.com free tier appears to have a negligible cold start delay; And the lowerst "Eco Nano" paid instance is just $1.61/month and should have no cold start delay at all

## Deployment Guide

   1. Register on Koyeb.com, free "hobbyist" plan is enough
   
   2. Create a Service -> Web Service -> Docker

   3. Configure Docker Image

      - Repository: `docker.io/aibelvedere/aibelvedere:latest`
      - Environment variables:
         - `SERVER_PORT=5500`
         - `OPENAI_API_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
         - `OPENAI_API_KEY=(your project API key for OpenAI)`
         - `ANTHROPIC_API_URL=https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`
         - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=(your API key for Anthropic)`
         - `LOG_DESTINATION_AZURE_LOG_ANALYTICS=N`
         - `LOG_DESTINATION_POSTGRESQL=N`
         - `LOG_DESTINATION_CONSOLE=Y`
         - `COMPANY_SYSTEM_PROMPT="A brief defauly system prompt instrusting LLM of its name (e.g. Belvedere), its role as an AI assistant to your family; Introducing your family to the AI Belvedere chatbot: who you are, what languages you speak, etc."`
         - `AUTH_AUTH0=N` for now, only temporary, until Auth0 is configured!

      - Exposed ports: 5500

      - Validate app via the Koyeb-provided app URL (e.g.: https://gleaming-creater-something-something-213123432423.koyeb.app/)
      
      - At this point it should work, but still does not require authentication. Unsafe!

   4. Optionally: upgrade to a Starter plan to attach a Custom Domain

      -  You will need to purchase a domain separately with any domain registrar, and point it to Koyeb

      -  See https://www.koyeb.com/docs/run-and-scale/domains#create-and-assign-your-domain-to-a-koyeb-app for more details

   5. Create an account on Auth0.com, create an Application (ex: "AI Belvedere - Appleseed family")

      - Add application logo (use public/favicon-516x516.png from this repo)

      - Application type: Regular Web App

      - APplication Login URI: leave blank

      - ** Note! In the various URLs configured below, the trailings are very important. Where an example has trailing / you should use it. Where an example does not have a trailing / you should not have it. **
      
      - Allowed Callback URLs: https://gleaming-creater-something-something-213123432423.koyeb.app/callback

      - Allowed Logout URLs: https://gleaming-creater-something-something-213123432423.koyeb.app/
        **Note: trailing / slash, it is important**

      - Allowed Web Origins: https://gleaming-creater-something-something-213123432423.koyeb.app
        **Note: no trailing slashes**

      - Allow Cross-Origin Authentication: Yes

      - Allowed Origins (CORS): https://gleaming-creater-something-something-213123432423.koyeb.app
        **Note: no trailing slashes**

      - ID Token Expiration: 2592000
      
   3. In Auth0, **do not create Social login connectors**. If Google was enabled by default, remove it. With social logins enabled, Auth0 will not limit the users to a predefined list of allowed users: anyone on the web will be able to sign up and use LLM under your API keys. You don't want that.

   4. In Auth0, in the User Management tab, create initial users with passwords

   5. Go back to Koyeb app and add more environment variables to enable authentication with Auth0

      - `AUTH_AUTH0=Y`
      - `OIDC_BASEURL=https://gleaming-creater-something-something-213123432423.koyeb.app/`
      - `OIDC_CLIENTID=Your Auth0 ClientID from the application that was created there`
      - `OIDC_ISSUERBASEURL=your Auth0 application URL, e.g. https://dev-llkj2l34kj34lj3455.us.auth0.com`

   6. Test the app by navigating to the Koyeb-provided URL again. It should now require authentication.
         
# üõ†Ô∏è Docker deployment to self-hosted AWS Lightsails VM

   TBD

   
# üõ†Ô∏è Deployment to Azure Container Apps: Step by Step Guide

   1. Create a Resource Group
   2. Create Azure Container Registry (Basic Tier)
      - Enable Admin Access (but no need to retain the password)
   3. Build, tag and push docker image
      - See command examples in the `./github/workflows/docker-image-to-acr.yml` pipeline
   4. Create Azure Key Vault
      - IAM policy type
      - Grant yourself an IAM role Secrets Officer
      - Create secrets named `openai-api-key`, `anthropic-api-key`
   6. Create Azure Container App (and let it automatically create a Container App Environment)
      - Select a container from ACR
      - Define environment variables for the app:
      ```
      AUTH_AAD_EXTERNAL=Y
      AUTH_AUTH0=N
      OPENAI_API_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
      OPENAI_API_KEY=placeholder
      ANTHROPIC_API_URL=https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=placeholder
      LOG_DESTINATION_AZURE_LOG_ANALYTICS=N
      LOG_DESTINATION_POSTGRESQL=N
      LOG_DESTINATION_CONSOLE=Y
      COMPANY_SYSTEM_PROMPT="... default system prompt"
      ```
      - Enable Ingress to port 5500 (public)
   7. After the Container App is deployed:
      - Configure Scaling (1 .. 1)
      - Define "Secrets" (`openai-api-key`, `anthropic-api-key`) as references to a Key Vault
      - Adjust environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) to reference these secrets
      - Enable Authentication with Azure Entra ID (details TBD)
   8. Enable Managed Identities and grant IAM Roles:
      - on Key Vault to the Container App [Key Vault Secrets User]
      - on ACR to the Container App [Role: AcrPull Role]

# üõ†Ô∏è Running it locally with client app pre-built and statically served

This local running mode is useful for testing authentication-related code and configurations (ex. with Auth0)

1. Ensure that you have the following installed:

   - [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14.18.0 or above)
   - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (6.14.15 or above)

2. Clone this repository

3. Create .env.server.local file to configure server-side
      ```
      OPENAI_API_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
      OPENAI_API_KEY=...
      ANTHROPIC_API_URL=https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...

      LOG_DESTINATION_AZURE_LOG_ANALYTICS=N;
      LOG_DESTINATION_POSTGRESQL=N;
      LOG_DESTINATION_CONSOLE=Y;

      COMPANY_SYSTEM_PROMPT="... default system prompt"

      AUTH_AUTH0=N
      AUTH_AAD_EXTERNAL=N
      ```

4. Create .env.production file to configure client-side build
      ```
      VITE_COMPANY_NAME=(Your Preferred Company/Group/Family name)
      VITE_ANTHROPIC_ENABLE=Y
      VITE_OPENAI_O1_ENABLE=Y
      VITE_CHECK_AAD_AUTH=N
      ```

5. Run `npm install`

6. Launch the app by running `**npm run client-build && npm run server**`

7. Navigate to http://localhost:5500
   

# üõ†Ô∏è Running it locally for client-side debugging through Vite
